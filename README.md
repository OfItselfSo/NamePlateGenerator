# NamePlateGenerator
Fast, Automated Generation of GCode Files to Engrave Text

The purpose of the NamePlateGenerator software is to automate the production of GCode files which creates engraved nameplates.

This project was created to meet a specific purpose for a given set of input and output requirements. The software is not polished and is not particularly productionised. 
This means that the operation is not as smooth and generic as might be desired and there are not as many features as there probably should be. There are, however, no known bugs. 
In addition, please realize that now that the software has done the job for which it was intended, development is essentially over as far as the author is concerned. 
Having said that, if you do make improvements or enhancements that would be useful to others (and which you would like to share) please generate a pull request.

The home page for this project can be found at [http://www.OfItselfSo.com/NamePlateGenerator](http://www.OfItselfSo.com/NamePlateGenerator). Please read the contents
of that page for detailed information regarding the softwares capabilities and usage instructions. A binary file is also available for those who do not wish to compile the C# source themselves.
